            <h2>A Wireframe for a CrossFit Companion App</h2>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>This is a wireframe for a potential iPhone app which I named “2 Plates”.  Check it out <a href="https://www.justinmind.com/usernote/tests/11448499/11448502/15247340/index.html#/screens/07a30267-1ad6-43a5-9793-5938e91a1c7d" target="_blank">HERE</a></p>
            <p>The concept for this project was to design a wireframe for a CrossFit Companion which would help users keep track of milestones achieved during their workout sessions.  This app is a combination of multiple other apps that are available on the market, as well as containing features that aren’t immediately available on the app store.</p>

            <div class="text2">
                <p>For example, it has a tool which allows users to record themselves, and then have the ability to draw on the video.  This would be useful for showing weaknesses in a users form during a specific exercise.  Another tool allows users to setup competitions called “ThrowDowns”, and also keep track of the progress of the competition.</p>
                <p>There are many more features of this app, and I think it does a good job of showing what is possible with a wire framing application.</p>

                <p>The main tab of the app was the "Profile" tab.  This is the homescreen for the user and contains a lot of the relevant information which I thought would be important for users.</p>
                <p>The top half of the application has a lot of the information about the user.  For example: a profile picture, a custom banner picture, as well as information about which gym the user attends, as well as natural age, and current age.</p>
                <p>The Middle of the application has some user data including how many workouts were recorded, how many of those were recent (within a 2 month period), how many Personal Records have been recorded, and how many ThrowDowns the user has participated in.  (Note: Throwdowns are custom fitness tournaments that organizations can setup.)</p>
                <br>
                <p>The bottom half of the application has informatino about the latest workout which includes: date of the workout, what the name of the workout was, and what the recorded Time / Score is.   It also includes the the navigation bar. </p>

                        The second interactive element for this project included an interactive map of the US which we hoped would express how much actual area a tiger needs inorder to live, hunt, and mate.  For this elements we used a really awesome online tool for visualizations called datawrapper.  It was really useful, and added a nice touch to the site.
