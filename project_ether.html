            <p>Once again my love for games and game development rears it's head, this time in the form of a sidescrolling shooter created in Xcode, Photoshop, and Art Text 2.  I love Sci-Fi themed stuff, from movies, to anime, to games.  So as soon as I saw a really nice Side Scroller walkthrough from the great guys at Pixel Nest, I knew I had to give it a shot.  </p>

                <p>One of the cool things that started popping up once the iPhone was released, were games that used the accelerometer within the phones as a control system.  I was never such a fan of this, partly because I'm bad, but also because I find the controls not as crisp as when you used a traditional 2 thumb setup</p>
                <p>I countered this by using a great open source control scheme called the Khaz controller to be able to better manipulate the player character.</p>

                I really enjoyed making all the different type of ships.  Also making all the planets was a great amount of fun.  It gave me the opportunity to learn some new tricks in Photoshop.

                       <p>Creating many different ships was one of the things I really wanted to do for this project.  Ideally the user would be able to choose from one of the 6 different ships when they start up the game. Unfortuneately I wasn't able to include that system, but I did create the ships themselves, as well as a Power Level chart which is shown below.  I have included 3 of the ships below, can you match up the names to the ships?</p> 
                        <p>Which ship is which? Check to see if the names work with the designs</p>
