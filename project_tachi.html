            When I saw that I had the opportunity to take 3D Modeling classes, I had to jump at it.  3D Modeling was something that I always wanted to learn, and I wasn't disapointed in how much fun it was.  For our classes, we used Maya to do all the modeling.  Some texturing and other things were created in photoshop, but for the most part we spent our entire time working with Maya.

                <p>When I saw Ghost in the Shell for the first time, I almost couldn't believe what I had seen. It was such an experience, and it stayed with me for a long time.</p>
                <p>So when we got this assignment, I immediately knew exactly what I wanted to make.  One of the most iconic units from the movie and show.  Luckily there were enough images online to help me reproduce the different parts as acurately as I could.  I'd like to thank my professor Alberto Cairo for mentoring me through this project.  Without his help, this never would have turned out as well as it did!</p>

                One of the requirements for this project was to have an infographic ready for the mid term.  I think mine came out alright, and even the professer remarked that it was "Quite Good".   I really enjoyed this project, and the rest of the class, and I hope that shows through my work.

                       <p>This screen shot is from within Maya and it shows the a front view of the wireframe.  One of the things you might notice is that the legs contain much more  poly's than the rest of the body, this is because of the smoothing that I had to employ on specific parts of the legs.</p>
                        <p>Getting the right shape of the legs was the biggest pain of the whole thing, but the extra time I spent on it makes it look that much more true to the original</p>
