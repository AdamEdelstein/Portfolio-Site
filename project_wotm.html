        <div class="intro">
            Although I love front end design, my passion is video games.  So for my capstone I teamed up with Frankling Zhang to create a video game from scratch.  One of the reasons I really like video game design is because I believe that it takes a bit of every art medium and mashes them all together in an interactive package.  With video games you get art, sound, animation, story telling, philosphy, and countless others.  The ability to take inspiration from everywhere in life is amazing.  I enjoyed this project so much, I would love to keep working on it, but sadly this was a one off.  I hope you enjoy!

                <p>My job in the game was to facilitate the game design process.  I also worked on the lighting, particles, as well as the ping system was developed by me.  Franklin Zhang was director and also took care of the art, while Ebby Wahman helped with coding and general issues with Unity</p>

                One of the first tasks we had was to try to nail down the type of colors and art style we wanted to use.  At some point someone mentioned that a water color style might work.  We also tried to go with bright appealing colors during the day, because at some points the user would be in complete darkness.  The light world must stand out to have the greatest impact.

                       <p>One of the earliest questions we had was what kind of game creation software did we want to use? We narrowed our selection down to three different choices, and in the end we chose Unity.  One of the reasons why we liked Unity was due to one of it’s newer features - “Unity2D”. </p> 
                        <p>Some of the features we liked about Unity2D are:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li> 2D Physics Engine</li>

                        <p>In early stages of development, our team decided that one of the features we really wanted in the game was a ability that allowed our Monk to navigate obstacles in the darkness. </p>  
                        <p>We went through several different concepts of this system, and in the end we decided on what we dubbed the “Ping” system. </p>
                        <p>The “Ping” is basically a echolocation system in which the monk would let out a force (perceived as light) and this force would temporarily show or brighten objects which wouldn’t be easily seen. </p>

                        <p>The ping itself was easy enough to make once we figured out how to accomplish it.  The ping itself is just a light, however we use a “cookie” which shapes the light as a ring.  A cookie is basically an object in front of a light which casts a shadow in order to add some patterned illumination.  </p>  
                        <p>After we had the light shaped the way we wanted it, we just added an animation which pulled the light and cookie assemble away from the object, which created the illusion of the ping expanding.</p>
                        <p>Then we added some particles to the animation which helped created a sense of magic which accompanies it.  
Here is a video of one of the earliest versions of the ping in action..
